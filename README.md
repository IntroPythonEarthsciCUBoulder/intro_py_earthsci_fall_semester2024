Lessons and assignments of Intro to Python Programming for Earth Sciences

Computer programming is virtually indispensable in modern geoscience. This course material provides an introduction to scientific computer programming using the Python language. 

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- Write a computer program in Python to solve a common scientific problem such as reading in and plotting data, analyzing a dataset by performing calculations on its values
- Perform repeted calculations using a mathematical model.
- Explain the basic elements of the Python programming language, such as variables, data types, operations, and functions.
- Use common scientific packages such as NumPy, Pandas, GeoPandas, visualisation packages such as MatplotLib and Seaborn.
- Understand and modify scientific Python scripts written by others.
- Draw on a portfolio of well-documented programming examples created during the semester for examples and reminders of how to write Python code for various types of application.
  
The material will be motivated using various geoscientific problems that involve programming.
